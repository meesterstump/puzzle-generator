Procedural Puzzle Generator
==================================

This is a procedural jigsaw puzzle generator that runs in the browser. It has
several configurable strategies that control the generation process allowing for
a variety of puzzle styles. It can produce an SVG file suitable for use with a
laser cutter or CNC machine for making physical puzzles.

Use the tool [here](https://weevilgenius.github.io/puzzle-generator/).

Project Goals
-------------

* A tool to generate interesting and pleasing jigsaw puzzle designs without having
  to draw them by hand.
* Clean, well-documented, and extensible codebase allowing others to add/modify/extend
  various algorithms for puzzle creation.
* Output compatible with laser cutters or CNC machines (SVG)

Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcome! The project is built with [Typescript] and [Vite] and
uses [Mithril] and [Web Awesome] to create a responsive user interface. Vector
rendering is powered by [Paper.js], which provides interactive canvas rendering
with built-in support for hit testing, transformations, and scene graph management.
The puzzle generation process is broken into three stages (seed points, piece
generation, tab generation), each of which can be extended with custom algorithms.
To add a new point, piece or tab shape, see the
[generator documentation](./src/geometry/README.md).

Building the project requires Node 20 or later and [pnpm].
